# Open Source

A software philosophy that promotes free redistribution and access to source code.

## Beginning Open Source

* [Get a GitHub account](http://github.com)
* Read about [software licenses](http://playbook.thoughtbot.com/#licenses)
* Read about [the purpose and formatting of a NEWS file](http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/NEWS-File.html#NEWS-File)
* Read about [the purpose and formatting of a ChangeLog file](http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Change-Logs.html#Change-Logs)

### You should be able to

* Evaluate a project based on quality of code, tests, documentation.
* Evaluate a project based on responsiveness of maintainers to developers' questions and feature requests.
* Evaluate a project based on regularity of releases.
* Evaluate a project based on the appropriateness of its license for your needs.
* Evaluate a project by downloading and trying it.
* Search issues for a similar problem you're having.
* Comment with additional data on issues that you're also having.
* Submit new issues with good environment (Ruby version, OS, etc.) info, error messages, and backtraces so the maintainer can quickly replicate it.

## Intermediate Open Source

* Read [8 steps to fixing other people's code](http://rdd.me/tsf7khhg)
* Read the [Semantic Versioning specification](http://semver.org)

### You should be able to

* Get annoyed by a defect or missing feature.
* Find the source code.
* Create a copy of the source ("fork" on Github).
* Check out (git clone) the source.
* Poke around the source in your editor and shell (grep).
* Read the contribution guidelines.
* Write a failing test in the style of the project's test suite.
* Write code to make the test pass in the style of the project's codebase.
* Make sure the entire test suite passes.
* Create a patch (push to your fork on Github).
* Submit a patch ("pull request" on Github).
* If it exists, email the project's mailing list asking for feedback.

## Advanced Open Source

* Watch [How to manage an open source project](http://vimeo.com/45214727)
* Read the [rubygems.org "Make your own gem" guide](http://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/)

### You should be able to

* Apply an appropriate license to your project.
* Document a clear public API.
* Document where issues are managed, such as Github Issues.
* Evaluate pull requests and provide kind, intelligent feedback.
* Provide a clear place for questions, such as Stack Overflow. Only provide a Google Group mailing list if you're ready to support it.
* Provide your code in easily accessible form (Rubygems, GitHub).
* Select or reject open source software based on its license.
* Use major, minor, and patch version numbers (Semantic Versioning).
