Trail map
=========

> How do I learn Ruby on Rails? Vim? Test-Driven Development?

[apprentice.io](http://apprentice.io) has forced us to formalize our answers to
such questions.

A few problems make those questions difficult to answer. Individuals:

* have different levels of experience
* have different learning styles
* change their goals mid-process

A good metaphor for the learning process is a (hiking, biking, or skiing)
trail map. Individuals:

* start in different places
* want to go to different places
* change direction mid-journey
