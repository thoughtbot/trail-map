# iOS

The mobile operating system that runs on the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Apple TV.

## Beginning iOS

* Read [Programming with Objective-C](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Introduction/introObjectiveC.html)
* Watch [Try Objective-C](http://tryobjectivec.codeschool.com)
* Watch [Try iOS](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ios)
* Read [Learn Objective-C on the Mac](http://amzn.to/learn-objective-c-mac)
* Read [Beginning iOS 6 Development: Exploring the iOS SDK](http://amzn.to/16DLdLy)
* Read [About Memory Management](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/MemoryMgmt.html)
* Read chapters 6 - 15, 17 - 19, 24, 28 - 30 of [Cocoa Design Patterns](http://amzn.to/cocoa-design-patterns)
* Read and hack on [sample code](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/#section=Resource%20Types&topic=Sample%20Code)
* Read the [Mobile Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html)

### You should be able to

* Use Xcode (and the built-in Interface Builder) to compile an iOS app.
* Use the basic data types (NSInteger, NSString), collection objects (NSArray, NSDictionary), and know when to use them instead of C primitives (int, char, etc).
* Design and use basic design patterns like MVC, delegates, callbacks, and notifications.
* Understand the difference between using the mutable (NSMutableArray, NSMutableDictionary, NSMutableString) and immutable objects in Objective-C, their advantages and disadvantages.
* Describe and use ARC and MRC for memory management, as well as the rules of the retain/release/autorelease cycle.
* Use the basic display and navigation elements (UIWindow, UIView, UINavigationBar, UIToolbar, etc).
* Implement a solution using an UITableView, with navigation and a custom UITableViewCell.
* Implement the various iOS controls (UISwitch, UILabel, UISegmentedControl, etc).
* Understand and implement the usage of iPad specific UI controls, UIPopoverController and UISplitView.
* Implement network communications using AFNetworking or NSURLConnection.
* Use CoreLocation to get location coordinates.
* Access the cameras to take pictures or access pictures from the device's photo gallery.
* Implement UX and design best practices as prescribed by Apple.
* Meet App Store submission requirements and submit an app.

## Advanced iOS

* Maintain an active ADC account and refer to the [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com).
* Keep up-to-date on [iOS news](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/#section=Resource%20Types&topic=Release%20Notes).
* Subscribe to [iOS Dev Weekly](http://iosdevweekly.com)
* Subscribe to [objc.io](http://www.objc.io)
* Subscribe to [NSHipster](http://www.nshipster.com)
* Learn about [Grand Central Dispatch](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Performance/Reference/GCD_libdispatch_Ref/Reference/reference.html)
* Learn about [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org)

### You should be able to

* Create and manage Core Data objects and schemas.
* Decide when to best use a category vs subclassing
* Decide when to best use Singletons.
* Decide when to best use Delegates.
* Decide when to best use Proxies.
* Decide when to best use Closures.
* Implement animations using CoreAnimation and optimize drawing using CoreGraphics.
* Implement a multi-tasking environment free of race conditions (using appropriate locking techniques such as mutexes and semaphores, message passing, etc).
* Implement task driven concurrency using the Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) framework.
* Design and use APIs that prefer the use of closures instead of selectors and delegates.
* Create and use UIStoryboards to define and organize the application flow and transitions between screens.
* Debug memory leaks using NSZombieEnabled, Instruments, and other tools.
* Use CocoaPods to define your project's dependencies.
* Create an universal app that contains code for both the iPhone/iPod and iPad devices.
