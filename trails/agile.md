Agile Development
=================

Stand Ups
---------

* Hold a brief (< 10 minutes) meeting every morning where team discusses:
  * What they've done
  * What they're doing
  * Any blockers and what action to take
* Stand-up's can be over IM, conference call or in person
* Blockers are things that are holding up work
* Keep blockers relevant to the actual tasks at hand; not the general project

Story Boards
------------

* Use a physical or [virtual](http://trello.com) board with tasks divided in to
  * Backlog (to-do list)
  * In Progress
  * (Optional stages e.g. In QA, In UAT)
  * Done (Released to production)
* Use the story board to aid visualisation of progress in stand ups

Backlog
-------

* Keep a "to-do list" of features for the project in one place in priority order

Sprints
-------

* Divide time in to short periods (2 weeks is good) - this is known as a sprint
* Take enough tasks from the top of the backlog to be achievable in the sprint
* A sprint _never_ runs over - remaining work is re-estimated and completed in the next sprint

Retrospectives
--------------

* Always have a retrospective at the end of a sprint
* Each team member should be able to discuss:
  * Things they thought went well
  * Things they thought could be improved
  * What we can do to improve the next sprint
* Review the action points of the previous retrospective to ensure improvement has been made
