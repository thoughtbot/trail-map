Validation
----------

You know everyday Open Source when you can:

* Understand when different licenses are appropriate to use (MIT, Creative Commons, GPL, Apache)
* Fork a repo, add code, and submit a pull request
* Evaluate pull requests and provide kind, intelligent feedback
* Submit pull requests which get merged
