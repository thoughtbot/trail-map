Validation
----------

You know everyday Objective-C and iOS development when you can:

* Use Xcode (and the built-in Interface Builder) to compile an iOS app.
* Describe and use ARC and MRC for memory mangement, as well as the rules of the retain/release/autorelease cycle.
* Use the basic data types (NSInteger, NSString), collection objects (NSArray, NSDictionary), and know when to use them instead of C primitives (int, char, etc).
* Understand the difference between using tne mutable (NSMutableArray, NSMutableDictionary, NSMutableString) and immutable objects in Objective-C, their advantaces and disavantages.
* Use the basic display and navigation elements (UIWindow, UIView, UINavigationBar, UIToolbar, etc).
* Implement a solution using an UITableView, with navigation and a custom UITableViewCell.
* Implement the various iOS controls (UISwitch, UILabel, UISegmentedControl, etc).
* Understand and implement the usage of iPad specific UI controls, UIPopoverController and UISplitView.
* Design and use basic design patterns like MVC, delegates, callbacks, and notifications.
* Use CoreLocation to get location coordinates.
* Access the cameras to take pictures or access pictures from the device's photo gallery.
* Implement network communications using AFNetworking or NSUrlConnection.
* Implement UX and design best practices as prescribed by Apple.
* Meet App Store submission requirements and submit an app.

You know advanced Objective-C & iOS Development when you can:

* Create and manage Core Data objects and schemas.
* Decide when to best use:
    * A category vs subclassing.
    * Singletons.
    * Delegates.
    * Proxies.
    * Closures.
* Implement animations using CoreAnimation and optimize drawing using CoreGraphics.
* Implement a multi-tasking environment free of race conditions (using appropriate locking techniques such as mutexes and semaphores, message passing, etc)
* Implement task driven concurrency using the [Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Performance/Reference/GCD_libdispatch_Ref/Reference/reference.html) framework.
* Design and use APIs that prefer the use of closures instead of selectors and delegates.
* Create and use UIStoryboards to define and organize the application flow and transitions between screens.
* Debug memory leaks using NSZombieEnabled, Instruments, and other tools.
* Use [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) to define your project's dependencies.
* Create an universal app that contains code for both the iPhone/iPod and iPad devices.
