Open Source
===========

Critical learning
-----------------

* Read [8 steps to fixing other people's code](http://rdd.me/tsf7khhg).
* Watch [How to manage an open source project](http://vimeo.com/45214727).
* Read the rubygems.org ["Make your own gem" guide](http://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/).
* Read the [Semantic Versioning specification](http://semver.org/).
* Understand [software licenses](http://playbook.thoughtbot.com/choosing-platforms/software-licenses/).
* Know what a [`NEWS` file](http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/NEWS-File.html#NEWS-File) is.
* Know what a [`ChangeLog` file](http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Change-Logs.html#Change-Logs)
  is and how it is formatted.

Validation
----------

You are an everyday open source user when you can:

* Evaluate a project based on quality of code, tests, documentation.
* Evaluate a project based on responsiveness of maintainers to developers'
  questions and feature requests.
* Evaluate a project based on regularity of releases.
* Evaluate a project based on the appropriateness of its license for your
  needs.
* Evaluate a project by downloading and trying it.
* Search issues for a similar problem you're having.
* Comment with additional data on issues that you're also having.
* Submit new issues with good environment (Ruby version, OS, etc.) info,
  error messages, and backtraces so the maintainer can quickly replicate it.

You are an everyday open source contributor when you can:

* Get annoyed by a defect or missing feature.
* Find the source code.
* Create a copy of the source ("fork" on Github).
* Check out (`git clone`) the source.
* Poke around the source in your editor and shell (`grep`).
* Read the contribution guidelines.
* Write a failing test in the style of the project's test suite.
* Write code to make the test pass in the style of the project's codebase.
* Make sure the entire test suite passes.
* Create a patch (push to your fork on Github).
* Submit a patch ("pull request" on Github).
* If it exists, email the project's mailing list asking for feedback.

You are an everyday open source maintainer when you can:

* Document a clear public API.
* Document where issues are managed, such as Github Issues.
* Provide a clear place for questions, such as Stack Overflow. Only provide
  a Google Group mailing list if you're ready to support it.
* Know how to use major, minor, and patch version numbers.
* Provide your code in easily accessible form (rubygems.org, Github).
* Evaluate pull requests and provide kind, intelligent feedback.
* Know which license to use.
