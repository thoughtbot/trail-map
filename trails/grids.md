Validation
----------

You can use a grid in a design when you can:

* Create inner axial alignment
* Have symmetrical and asymmetrical balance in your designs
* Use a more complex grid system than a equal column 3 or 4 column grid
* Edit and/or build a grid according to the content in your design (not using a prebuilt framework)
* Keep consistent vertical and horizontal space
* Use the grid to strengthen the contents hierarchy
* Use the grid to create active white space within a design
