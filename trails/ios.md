Validation
----------

You know everyday Objective-C and iOS development when you can:

* use Xcode (and the built-in Interface Builder) to compile an iOS app.
* describe and use ARC and MRC for memory mangement, as well as the rules of the retain/release cycle.
* use the basic data types (NSInteger, NSString), collection objects (NSArray, NSDictionary), and know when to use them instead of C primitives (int, char, etc).
* use the basic display and navigation elements (UIWindow, UIView, UINavigationBar, UIToolbar, etc).
* implement the various iOS controls (UISwitch, UILabel, UISegmentedControl, etc).
* design and use basic design patterns like MVC, delegates, callbacks, and notifications.
* use CoreLocation to get location coordinates.
* implement network communications using AFNetworking, ASI, or NSUrlConnection.
* implement UX and design best practices as prescribed by Apple.
* meet App Store submission requirements and submit an app.

You know advanced Objective-C & iOS Development when you can:

* create and manage Core Data objects and schemas.
* decide when to best use:
    * a category vs subclassing.
    * singletons.
    * delegates.
    * proxies.
* implement animations using CoreAnimation and optimize drawing using CoreGraphics.
* implement a multi-tasking environment free of race conditions (using appropriate locking techniques such as mutexes and semaphores, message passing, etc).
* debug memory leaks using NSZombieEnabled, Instruments, and other tools.

Ongoing reference
